    Hi, I am Bhavesh Shah! 
    Welcome to my Web Development portfolio page where I intend to share my journey of learning and progress. 

    I have worked on few CLI apps which I will showcase it tomorrow.

    Favourite Book: Unposted Letters by T.T. Rangarajan
    Unposted Letters has been one of my favourite books. The title itself is very enticing for me. This book is about building character via T.T.Rangarajan's life experiences. The great thing about the content is that no chapter is nore than 3 pages.
